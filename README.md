BEANSTALKD WORKER EXAMPLE
===============

This example project is just a very quick implementation of a beanstalkd worker.
You can adapt it for your needs.

As a bonus, I also made a worker that sends sms messages using Nexmo's REST API.

If you find any bugs please tell me because I intend to clean up the code a bit and use it in production for a upcoming project.

You can change the worker.go file for your own purposes very easily.
